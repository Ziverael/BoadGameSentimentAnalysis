Mais en soi, les mécaniques du jeu sont simple et les actions très faciles à assimiler avec des stratégies plutôt commodes à mettre en place et lisibles. Il est assez facile de savoir ce que poursuit un adversaire. Reste alors à évaluer s'il est plus intéressant d'interférer avec son projet d'action ou plutôt de se concentrer sur sa propre stratégie, ou mieux encore de parvenir à faire les deux à la fois.

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a [person=6]Martin Wallace[/person] game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup.

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a Martin Wallace game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup. I definitely will play this again, since even just this bad experience was enough to show me how to have a better time next time.

Emellett pedig még van benne hálózatépítés, fejlesztés, és joker kártyákat is tudunk szerezni. Összességében egy tematikus és igazán élvezhető játék.\\n(A Lancashire szűkössége, jobban tetszik, és ott nincs funkcióvesztett mechanika, mint amilyen itt a felülépítés. Ennek az oka szerintem, hogy a Birmingham sokkal kényelmesebb. Talán mi játszottuk rosszul.)\\n\\nVery good strategy game.\\nThe strategy can really take centre stage alongside tactics (card options). The interaction between players leads to interesting decisions: you can use the materials from each other's factories to build, but you are also doing your opponent a favour by this, but he might have needed that resource (especially in the case of beer, which you can't buy on the market). Also, there is networking, upgrading, and you can get joker cards.

В ней всё здорово переплетается между собой, не смотря на то, что игра на самом деле не простая и комплексная(ну много в ней всякого!), но у меня практически не возникало каких-то вопросов или игровых нюансов и всё сведено к тому, что ты делаешь в свой ход всего лишь 2 действия выбирая из нескольких простых и понятных вариантов, но при этом каждое из этих действий даёт множество выборов и из них интересно выбирать т.к ситуация на поле постоянно изменяется и помимо твоих выборов, влияет и то как будут ходить другие игроки и что они построят в свой ход, ведь они могут забрать твой уголь\\\\пиво или занять ячейку\\\\дорогу на поле, что не всегда является «негативным взаимодействием», а наоборот может увеличить твою прибыль и ты точно так же можешь пользоваться чужими дорогами и ресурсами себе во благо.\\n\\nЯ люблю, когда в играх минимум компонентов и они многофункциональны, что обычно создаёт много выборов и возможностей во время хода, при этом игра не занимает излишне много места на столе. Она радует во всяких мелочах, которые в сумме дают положительный опыт - нет счётчика раундов чтобы отмерять когда наступает вторая эпоха, таймер сделали в виде колоды из которой добираете карты и это не отвлекает вас во время игры. Счётчик победных очков и прибыли объединили сэкономив игровое пространство. Потраченные деньги = порядок хода. Сама иконографика на поле, зданиях, планшетах и жетонах удобная и понятная, при этом они двухсторонние и каждая сторона функциональна, они отображают активное состояние и бонусы, в игре нет ничего что было бы написано\\\\нарисовано просто так для красоты, практически всё имеет какую-то игровую функцию. \\n\\nМне игра понравилась, и не зря она занимает своё высокое место, но для меня она точно не стала топ 1 и вряд ли в мой топ 10 заберётся после этой единственной партии. Не скажу, что у меня были какие-то большие ожидания от игры и они не оправдались, но и нету чувства, что игра меня чем-то зацепила, из-за чего я бы высоко её для себя оценил, это просто очень хорошая игра (не середнячок!), в которую я бы с удовольствием сыграл.

       " \"Played the new BRASS: BIRMINGHAM yesterday and completely blown away by it (even though I sucked at it). Strong core mechanics, very compelling and elegant gameplay and the most kick-ass production for a Euro I have ever seen (without being  over-produced like most KS games I see). This is Brass done right.  Can't wait to play again...& again!\\n\\nMy biggest critique of the game (if at all) is related to its major strength—aesthetics. While the art IS spectacular and looks just that on the computer screen where the light of a thousand suns from tiny pixels bring out all the details, I am afraid the printing process does not do justice to the darker palette. This severely impairs the playing of the game in sub-optimal lighting conditions (many cafes, pubs and non-game room areas in condo apartments have this problem). The location banners have similar tonal values and hence can be hard to identify (again, ONLY in sub-optimal lighting conditions) Having said that, it does look AWESOME in natural daylight and/well-lit rooms. I am only making this point because I am REALLY loving the game and wish it was as perfect as it could have been. \\n\\nAlso, because of the Kickstarter success, it would have been very practical and helpful if a stretch goal was player trays to go with the awesome player mats so all the tiles could be stored in the correct place and the game does not need the 5-6 min painful setup of sorting and placing tiles. Much like games such as Wasteland Express , Reckoners etc. Love the Iron Clays though...cant imagine playing without them!\\n--------------------\\n\\nFavorite things...\\n► Brass: Birmingham reinvents a classic, building upon what worked the most and improving things that did not. The depth the game offers relative to its complexity and ruleset is simply the best.\\n► The player interaction is another highlight for me. The game works like a dynamic shared economy where every action affects others—networks, market prices, and resource access make Brass feel alive and competitive. This is my absolute favorite kind of player interaction.\\n► There are multiple paths to victory, which serve a varied degree of challenges, allowing players to pick what seems most challenging and/or fun for them.\\n\\nMore, on this & other games in my ALL TIME - TOP 100  on my ⟣⧗First Pass⧗⟢ Blog:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/blog/9052/blogpost/172984/anim8rs-top-100-from-1000-2024-25-to-01\",\n",

Yes, you can cut someone's network short with your own, but that means you're likely cutting your own network too. Other players can use each other's networks anyway in many cases.

It is quite easy to know what an opponent is pursuing. It then remains to evaluate whether it is more interesting to interfere with one's action plan or rather to concentrate on one's own strategy, or better yet to manage to do both at the same time. But overall the game remains of rather average difficulty and even quite accessible (a new player will not be lost like when faced with a Dune or a Narak).\\n\\nA game will take two to three hours depending on the experience of the players and their speed of execution. The split into two periods with an almost complete reset, except for a few Tier II or III buildings is quite interesting. Another advantage of the game is that we are rarely stuck, with a fairly varied action path (while remaining simple and easy to learn).

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a [person=6]Martin Wallace[/person] game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup.

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a Martin Wallace game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup. I definitely will play this again, since even just this bad experience was enough to show me how to have a better time next time.

(It's not about the components, but about the convenience of the iconography and components). Everything in it is very intertwined, despite the fact that the game is actually not simple and complex (well, there’s a lot of stuff in it!), but I practically didn’t have any questions or game nuances and it all boils down to the fact that you do only 2 actions on your turn, choosing from several simple and understandable options, but at the same time, each of these actions gives many choices and it’s interesting to choose from them because the situation on the field is constantly changing and in addition to your choices, it also affects how others will move players and what they will build on their turn, because they can take your coal/beer or take a cell/road on the field, which is not always a “negative interaction”, but on the contrary can increase your profit and you can also use other people’s roads and resources for your own benefit.\\n\\nI like games to have minimal components and be feature rich, which usually creates a lot of choices and possibilities during a turn without the game taking up unnecessarily much space on the table. It pleases in all sorts of little things, which in total give a positive experience - there is no round counter to measure when the second era begins, the timer is made in the form of a deck from which you draw cards and this does not distract you during the game. The counter for victory points and profits was combined, saving playing space. Money spent = turn order. The iconography itself on the field, buildings, tablets and tokens is convenient and clear, while they are double-sided and each side is functional, they display the active state and bonuses, there is nothing in the game that is written/drawn just for beauty, almost everything has some kind of game function. \\n\\nI liked the game, and it’s not for nothing that it takes its high place, but for me it definitely didn’t become top 1 and is unlikely to get into my top 10 after this single game. I won’t say that I had any high expectations from the game and they were not met, but I also don’t feel that the game hooked me in any way, which is why I would rate it highly for myself, it’s just a very good game (not mediocre!) that I would play with pleasure.

The location banners have similar tonal values and hence can be hard to identify (again, ONLY in sub-optimal lighting conditions) Having said that, it does look AWESOME in natural daylight and/well-lit rooms. I am only making this point because I am REALLY loving the game and wish it was as perfect as it could have been. \\n\\nAlso, because of the Kickstarter success, it would have been very practical and helpful if a stretch goal was player trays to go with the awesome player mats so all the tiles could be stored in the correct place and the game does not need the 5-6 min painful setup of sorting and placing tiles. Much like games such as Wasteland Express , Reckoners etc. Love the Iron Clays though...cant imagine playing without them!\\n--------------------\\n\\nFavorite things...\\n► Brass: Birmingham reinvents a classic, building upon what worked the most and improving things that did not. The depth the game offers relative to its complexity and ruleset is simply the best.\\n► The player interaction is another highlight for me. The game works like a dynamic shared economy where every action affects others—networks, market prices, and resource access make Brass feel alive and competitive. This is my absolute favorite kind of player interaction.\\n► There are multiple paths to victory, which serve a varied degree of challenges, allowing players to pick what seems most challenging and/or fun for them.\\n\\nMore, on this & other games in my ALL TIME - TOP 100  on my ⟣⧗First Pass⧗⟢ Blog:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/blog/9052/blogpost/172984/anim8rs-top-100-from-1000-2024-25-to-01\",\n",

Yes, you can cut someone's network short with your own, but that means you're likely cutting your own network too. Other players can use each other's networks anyway in many cases.

It is likely that his evaluation benefits from a conformity bias, it is number 1 on BBG so it necessarily becomes excellent. But personally, I would only rate it as very good, it doesn't spark in me the excitement that makes some games exceptional.\\n\\nIn the same way its weight rating is greatly overestimated, let me explain: as it is number 1, it attracts a curious public not accustomed to expert games and as it is an excellent introductory game to these, it can appear heavy and complex to an uninformed public. But in itself, the mechanics of the game are simple and the actions very easy to assimilate with strategies that are rather easy to implement and readable. It is quite easy to know what an opponent is pursuing. It then remains to evaluate whether it is more interesting to interfere with one's action plan or rather to concentrate on one's own strategy, or better yet to manage to do both at the same time. But overall the game remains of rather average difficulty and even quite accessible (a new player will not be lost like when faced with a Dune or a Narak).\\n\\nA game will take two to three hours depending on the experience of the players and their speed of execution. The split into two periods with an almost complete reset, except for a few Tier II or III buildings is quite interesting. Another advantage of the game is that we are rarely stuck, with a fairly varied action path (while remaining simple and easy to learn). However, if an imbalance occurs, it will still be quite complex to stem and sometimes the winner is known six or seven actions before the end.\\n\\nIn short, an overall very positive assessment, but undoubtedly not up to the promises aroused by its ratings and its hype.\"),\n",

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a [person=6]Martin Wallace[/person] game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup. I definitely [i]will[/i] play this again, since even just this bad experience was enough to show me how to have a better time next time.

This games rules were abit fiddly and required constant review. The theme was  unique and building a serious of interconnected industries has its merits in terms of game play. It kept my interest to a degree but it also at times felt like a tedious affair that often became repetitive. You build coal plants, then an ironworks and connected them to a network. Then you build factories and attempt to sell them , but wait you need beer to do so. After a few rounds I started to think is this it? Why is this game rated number one? It is OK but number one?  So overall I was not that impressed with this one. I have rated close to 650 games here on bgg and have been playing mainly wargames for 45 years and found this one to be one that was costly and from a cost benefit viewpoint expensive.

The distant market push-your-luck element is gone, replaced with merchant beer barrels that are first come first served. Three distinct industry types to pursue and score from. The map does feel slightly more open and permissive. I don\\'t see it as a definitive good or bad thing, it really just comes down to preferences and/or mood. I\\'m probably not going to buy this, but if I had money to burn, I don\\'t see why not to own both versions. Do I think this is the best game in the world?

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a Martin Wallace game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup. I definitely will play this again, since even just this bad experience was enough to show me how to have a better time next time. But my overall impression of the game is that it's probably really fun for people who want to play it a lot, and I don't think I'm there.\"),\n",

Check.\\n- Beer needs connection, unless it\\'s yours because then it warps.  Oooookay?\\n- Iron, always warps. What?\\n\\nThe game:\\nYou\\'re trying to be a successful businessman during the industrial revolution by handing over your resources to just anyone... for free. Because after your mine runs out it starts to produce revenue. Because that\\'s what it does!\\nYou can also get successful by building connections between the cities aka. you can have a transportation business. Sounds good! It pays absolutely nothing and only gives victory points at the end of the eras, but it can give half your points! So during the game it\\'s almost entirely useless and you build most of it out of necessity but it\\'s a huge factor in your success. Makes sense? Not for me.\\n\\nAnd what absolutely doesn\\'t influence your success is how much money you make from round to round... because money plays absolutely no role in business, right?!\\n\\nBtw, it\\'s not a strategy game. The biggest strategy you have to \"build\" is when not to spend money. Other than that it\\'s mostly opportunitism and making the most out of the random cards you draw. It\\'s not bad, I just do not understand how is it the no.1 strategy game without any strategy.  :/\\n\\nOh, and the interaction between the players is not positive. Everyone gonna try to take their opponents resources in a way that it is the least beneficial for their opponent. The one taking the resource is not interested in emptying the tile while just getting rid of 1 resorce gives nothing for the owner. It is more like passive agressive.\\n\\nIn short: the game is illogical and the lack of agency over your resources annoys me so much that if I never see this game again even that will be too soon.'),\n",

       "  \"Played 1 game for four in 2:30\\n\\nWe finally tried the game that ranks first on BGG!\\n\\nFor me, the success of this game is in the game design and how they were able to design it. (It's not about the components, but about the convenience of the iconography and components). Everything in it is very intertwined, despite the fact that the game is actually not simple and complex (well, there’s a lot of stuff in it!), but I practically didn’t have any questions or game nuances and it all boils down to the fact that you do only 2 actions on your turn, choosing from several simple and understandable options, but at the same time, each of these actions gives many choices and it’s interesting to choose from them because the situation on the field is constantly changing and in addition to your choices, it also affects how others will move players and what they will build on their turn, because they can take your coal/beer or take a cell/road on the field, which is not always a “negative interaction”, but on the contrary can increase your profit and you can also use other people’s roads and resources for your own benefit.\\n\\nI like games to have minimal components and be feature rich, which usually creates a lot of choices and possibilities during a turn without the game taking up unnecessarily much space on the table. It pleases in all sorts of little things, which in total give a positive experience - there is no round counter to measure when the second era begins, the timer is made in the form of a deck from which you draw cards and this does not distract you during the game. The counter for victory points and profits was combined, saving playing space. Money spent = turn order. The iconography itself on the field, buildings, tablets and tokens is convenient and clear, while they are double-sided and each side is functional, they display the active state and bonuses, there is nothing in the game that is written/drawn just for beauty, almost everything has some kind of game function. \\n\\nI liked the game, and it’s not for nothing that it takes its high place, but for me it definitely didn’t become top 1 and is unlikely to get into my top 10 after this single game. I won’t say that I had any high expectations from the game and they were not met, but I also don’t feel that the game hooked me in any way, which is why I would rate it highly for myself, it’s just a very good game (not mediocre!) that I would play with pleasure.

Brass is a game that absolutely has \"right\" and \"wrong\" moves for any given board state and combination of cards in hand. So, it is a great puzzle in how to identify and execute the most efficient plays. The economic element is essential to great plays. However, if I were to be critical I think it just doesn\\'t provide the \"wow\" factor of a big play. Let\\'s say you sell your level 5 pottery (something I\\'ve never done).

       "  \"Played the new BRASS: BIRMINGHAM yesterday and completely blown away by it (even though I sucked at it). Strong core mechanics, very compelling and elegant gameplay and the most kick-ass production for a Euro I have ever seen (without being  over-produced like most KS games I see). This is Brass done right.  Can't wait to play again...& again!\\n\\nMy biggest critique of the game (if at all) is related to its major strength—aesthetics. While the art IS spectacular and looks just that on the computer screen where the light of a thousand suns from tiny pixels bring out all the details, I am afraid the printing process does not do justice to the darker palette. This severely impairs the playing of the game in sub-optimal lighting conditions (many cafes, pubs and non-game room areas in condo apartments have this problem). The location banners have similar tonal values and hence can be hard to identify (again, ONLY in sub-optimal lighting conditions) Having said that, it does look AWESOME in natural daylight and/well-lit rooms. I am only making this point because I am REALLY loving the game and wish it was as perfect as it could have been. \\n\\nAlso, because of the Kickstarter success, it would have been very practical and helpful if a stretch goal was player trays to go with the awesome player mats so all the tiles could be stored in the correct place and the game does not need the 5-6 min painful setup of sorting and placing tiles. Much like games such as Wasteland Express , Reckoners etc. Love the Iron Clays though...cant imagine playing without them!\\n--------------------\\n\\nFavorite things...\\n► Brass: Birmingham reinvents a classic, building upon what worked the most and improving things that did not. The depth the game offers relative to its complexity and ruleset is simply the best.\\n► The player interaction is another highlight for me. The game works like a dynamic shared economy where every action affects others—networks, market prices, and resource access make Brass feel alive and competitive. This is my absolute favorite kind of player interaction.\\n► There are multiple paths to victory, which serve a varied degree of challenges, allowing players to pick what seems most challenging and/or fun for them.\\n\\nMore, on this & other games in my ALL TIME - TOP 100  on my ⟣⧗First Pass⧗⟢ Blog:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/blog/9052/blogpost/172984/anim8rs-top-100-from-1000-2024-25-to-01\"),\n",

Slightly better than Lancashire, I think, and a major improvement over original Brass in terms of looks.\\n\\nKey downside in my opinion is that the card actions are hard to remember and manage, especially with new players. People need to be very diligent about spending cards for actions and drawing back up to 8 cards. Very, very common to get to the end of an era with one person having too many cards.'),\n",

If you manage to get out one of your buildings that don't get removed by this soft reset after the first era, they will score twice.\\n\\nI have heard countless times that this game was very cutthroat, but honestly, I didn't find it so compared to other network building games. Yes, you can cut someone's network short with your own, but that means you're likely cutting your own network too. Other players can use each other's networks anyway in many cases. I guess you can steal other players' building spots, but that is not enough to call a game cutthroat for me. i don't generally like cutthroat games, but I did like this.\"),\n",

Sometimes it makes me wonder: so this is how capitalism works - everyone works for their own advantage but it somehow all falls into place and everyone is better off?!?
