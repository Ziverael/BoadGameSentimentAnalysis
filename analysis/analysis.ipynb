Much of this game is what I would have expected from a [person=6]Martin Wallace[/person] game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I\\'m going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don\\'t think our teach was particularly good, which I\\'ve noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn\\'t care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren\\'t interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn\\'t really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn\\'t a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there\\'s not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup. I definitely [i]will[/i] play this again, since even just this bad experience was enough to show me how to have a better time next time. But my overall impression of the game is that it\\'s probably really fun for people who want to play it a lot, and I don\\'t think I\\'m there.\", \\'reviewer_country\\': \\'United States\\', \\'rating\\': 6.0, \\'date\\': \\'2024-12-11 09:34:59\\', \\'is_owner\\': False}',\n",

It kept my interest to a degree but it also at times felt like a tedious affair that often became repetitive. You build coal plants, then an ironworks and connected them to a network.

I say that, but maybe it only feels smoother because I come into this with some existing experience with Lancashire, whereas when first playing Lancashire it was from a blank slate. I think the beer mechanism is cool, and I also question how much it really adds to the game. Mechanically it\\\\\\'s the same game fundamentally as Lancashire, only differences are in the details. The distant market push-your-luck element is gone, replaced with merchant beer barrels that are first come first served. Three distinct industry types to pursue and score from. The map does feel slightly more open and permissive. I don\\\\\\'t see it as a definitive good or bad thing, it really just comes down to preferences and/or mood. I\\\\\\'m probably not going to buy this, but if I had money to burn, I don\\\\\\'t see why not to own both versions. Do I think this is the best game in the world? Perhaps if I squint hard and look at it from the right angle, maybe. It\\\\\\'s a very multidimensional game of entangled economic interests and network building, more expansive than Lancashire, but also perhaps a little less sharp and to the point. If I have any quibbles about the Brass system in general, it might be that it is next to impossible to gauge how you or anyone else is doing, at least at the level that I\\\\\\'m currently playing at. Everyone does \"stuff\", and then you count up the points at the end and see who won.

I\\\\\\'m not saying it\\\\\\'s not good, but for my taste... it\\\\\\'s just a nightmare.\\\\n\\\\nMy hatred against this boils down to: in my opinion the rules, the scoring... the game makes no sense.\\\\nHow?\\\\nWell, the rules:\\\\n- Coal needs connection. Check.\\\\n- Beer needs connection, unless it\\\\\\'s yours because then it warps.  Oooookay?\\\\n- Iron, always warps. What?\\\\n\\\\nThe game:\\\\nYou\\\\\\'re trying to be a successful businessman during the industrial revolution by handing over your resources to just anyone... for free. Because after your mine runs out it starts to produce revenue. Because that\\\\\\'s what it does!\\\\nYou can also get successful by building connections between the cities aka. you can have a transportation business. Sounds good! It pays absolutely nothing and only gives victory points at the end of the eras, but it can give half your points! So during the game it\\\\\\'s almost entirely useless and you build most of it out of necessity but it\\\\\\'s a huge factor in your success. Makes sense? Not for me.\\\\n\\\\nAnd what absolutely doesn\\\\\\'t influence your success is how much money you make from round to round... because money plays absolutely no role in business, right?!\\\\n\\\\nBtw, it\\\\\\'s not a strategy game. The biggest strategy you have to \"build\" is when not to spend money. Other than that it\\\\\\'s mostly opportunitism and making the most out of the random cards you draw. It\\\\\\'s not bad, I just do not understand how is it the no.1 strategy game without any strategy.  :/\\\\n\\\\nOh, and the interaction between the players is not positive. Everyone gonna try to take their opponents resources in a way that it is the least beneficial for their opponent. The one taking the resource is not interested in emptying the tile while just getting rid of 1 resorce gives nothing for the owner. It is more like passive agressive.\\\\n\\\\nIn short: the game is illogical and the lack of agency over your resources annoys me so much that if I never see this game again even that will be too soon.\\', \\'reviewer_country\\': \\'\\', \\'rating\\': 1.0, \\'date\\': \\'2025-07-11 17:53:24\\', \\'is_owner\\': False}',\n",

(It's not about the components, but about the convenience of the iconography and components). Everything in it is very intertwined, despite the fact that the game is actually not simple and complex (well, there’s a lot of stuff in it!), but I practically didn’t have any questions or game nuances and it all boils down to the fact that you do only 2 actions on your turn, choosing from several simple and understandable options, but at the same time, each of these actions gives many choices and it’s interesting to choose from them because the situation on the field is constantly changing and in addition to your choices, it also affects how others will move players and what they will build on their turn, because they can take your coal\\\\\\\\beer or take a cell\\\\\\\\road on the field, which is not always a “negative interaction”, but on the contrary can increase your profit and you can also use other people’s roads and resources for your benefit.\\\\n\\\\nI love when games have a minimum of components and they are multifunctional, which usually creates a lot of choices and opportunities during a turn, while the game does not take up too much space on the table. It pleases in all sorts of little things, which in total give a positive experience - there is no round counter to measure when the second era begins, the timer is made in the form of a deck from which you draw cards and this does not distract you during the game. The counter for victory points and profits was combined, saving playing space. Money spent = turn order. The iconography itself on the field, buildings, tablets and tokens is convenient and clear, while they are double-sided and each side is functional, they display the active state and bonuses, there is nothing in the game that is written\\\\\\\\drawn just for beauty, almost everything has some kind of game function. \\\\n\\\\nI liked the game, and it’s not for nothing that it occupies its high place, but for me it definitely didn’t become top 1 and is unlikely to get into my top 10 after this single game. I won’t say that I had any high expectations from the game and they were not met, but I also don’t feel that the game hooked me in any way, which is why I would rate it highly for myself, it’s just a very good game (not mediocre!) that I would play with pleasure.

Strong core mechanics, very compelling and elegant gameplay and the most kick-ass production for a Euro I have ever seen (without being  over-produced like most KS games I see). This is Brass done right.  Can\\'t wait to play again...& again!\\\\n\\\\nMy biggest critique of the game (if at all) is related to its major strength—aesthetics. While the art IS spectacular and looks just that on the computer screen where the light of a thousand suns from tiny pixels bring out all the details, I am afraid the printing process does not do justice to the darker palette. This severely impairs the playing of the game in sub-optimal lighting conditions (many cafes, pubs and non-game room areas in condo apartments have this problem). The location banners have similar tonal values and hence can be hard to identify (again, ONLY in sub-optimal lighting conditions) Having said that, it does look AWESOME in natural daylight and/well-lit rooms. I am only making this point because I am REALLY loving the game and wish it was as perfect as it could have been. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, because of the Kickstarter success, it would have been very practical and helpful if a stretch goal was player trays to go with the awesome player mats so all the tiles could be stored in the correct place and the game does not need the 5-6 min painful setup of sorting and placing tiles. Much like games such as Wasteland Express , Reckoners etc. Love the Iron Clays though...cant imagine playing without them!\\\\n--------------------\\\\n\\\\nFavorite things...\\\\n► Brass: Birmingham reinvents a classic, building upon what worked the most and improving things that did not. The depth the game offers relative to its complexity and ruleset is simply the best.\\\\n► The player interaction is another highlight for me. The game works like a dynamic shared economy where every action affects others—networks, market prices, and resource access make Brass feel alive and competitive. This is my absolute favorite kind of player interaction.\\\\n► There are multiple paths to victory, which serve a varied degree of challenges, allowing players to pick what seems most challenging and/or fun for them.\\\\n\\\\nMore, on this & other games in my ALL TIME - TOP 100  on my ⟣⧗First Pass⧗⟢ Blog:\\\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/blog/9052/blogpost/172984/anim8rs-top-100-from-1000-2024-25-to-01\", \\'reviewer_country\\': \\'Canada\\', \\'rating\\': 10.0, \\'date\\': \\'2017-04-04 08:28:49\\', \\'is_owner\\': False}',\n",

A frustrating, lengthy, overly procedural experience that offers less interaction than the original. Lowered rating to a 6. I'm surprised more gamers new to the system don't bounce off Birmingham. \\n===================================================\\nFinally got this to the table after almost a dozen plays of Lancashire.\\n\\nBirmingham is much fiddlier. Much more difficult to put together a sequence of useful actions. The addition of beer, and the wonky benefits of manufactured goods and pottery, make for a more uneven and frustrating experience all around. That’s not sour grapes - I won handily.\\n\\nPresumably, Birmingham is intended to refresh the challenge for people who have played out Lancashire. Fair enough. But I won’t be coming back to it any time soon - Lancashire isn’t a lifestyle game for me, so at 6-7 plays a year I expect I have years of play before it starts to get stale. I doubt Birmingham sees the table again in that time.\",\n",

Seeing this level of interaction in a Euro is so refreshing. The players have immense agency over the state of the game, and the way it all comes together is magical.\\n\\nThat said, some of the rules are incredibly unintuitive, bordering on arcane (iron can teleport, coal cannot, beer can for you, etc). There's enough weirdness to make it genuinely difficult to explain with a straight face. It's not particularly complex in the traditional sense; there's not that many actions you can take, but these strange caveats combined with the obtuse nature of how to actually play the game well makes for a large barrier to entry. I also find the game can veer into being slightly dry after many plays.\\n\\nStill, this is an amazing design. My only real critiques are in regards to the teach, and once players learn it this is a masterpiece. The fact that this game allows for this level of enmeshment between the players is a breath of fresh air, and something I must find more of. \",\n",

Il est probable que son évaluation bénéficie d'un biais de conformisme, c'est le numéro 1 sur BBG donc il devient nécessairement excellent. Mais personnellement, je ne le qualifierais que de très bon, il ne suscite pas en moi l'excitation qui rend certains jeux exceptionnels.\\n\\nDe la même façon sa note de poids est grandement surévaluée, je m'explique : comme il est numéro 1, il attire un public curieux peu habitué aux jeux experts et comme c'est un excellent jeu d'introduction à ceux-là, il peut apparaître lourd et complexe à un public non averti. Mais en soi, les mécaniques du jeu sont simple et les actions très faciles à assimiler avec des stratégies plutôt commodes à mettre en place et lisibles. Il est assez facile de savoir ce que poursuit un adversaire. Reste alors à évaluer s'il est plus intéressant d'interférer avec son projet d'action ou plutôt de se concentrer sur sa propre stratégie, ou mieux encore de parvenir à faire les deux à la fois. Mais globalement le jeu reste d'une difficulté plutôt moyenne et même assez accessible (un nouveau joueur ne sera pas perdu comme devant un Dune ou un Narak).\\n\\nUne partie prendra deux à trois heures selon l'expérience des joueurs et leur rapidité d'exécution. La séparation en deux périodes avec une réinitialisation presque complète, à l'exception de quelques bâtiments de niveau II ou III est assez intéressante. Autre intérêt du jeu, on est rarement bloqué, avec un chemin d'action assez variées (tout en restant simples et aisées à prendre en main). Cependant, si un déséquilibre se fait, il sera malgré tout assez complexe à endiguer et parfois le vainqueur est connu six ou sept actions avant la fin.\\n\\nBref, un bilan globalement très positif, mais sans doute pas à la hauteur des promesses suscitées par ses notes et sa hype.\",\n",

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a [person=6]Martin Wallace[/person] game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup. I definitely [i]will[/i] play this again, since even just this bad experience was enough to show me how to have a better time next time. But my overall impression of the game is that it's probably really fun for people who want to play it a lot, and I don't think I'm there.\",\n",

It kept my interest to a degree but it also at times felt like a tedious affair that often became repetitive. You build coal plants, then an ironworks and connected them to a network.

       " {'review': 'It is a good game on a unique topic. Who knew that the Industrial Revolution could be such a great topic to game. Overall as a gaming experience I found it interesting. You take on the role of a industrialist who builds an industrial empire. The mechanics have a unique historical flair but are abit fiddly on your first game. It takes some time to internalize key game concepts. As a result I was constantly reviewing the rule book on my first plays. The components are way above average but one negative is the dark feature or shading. You will need good lighting to fully appreciate the art work. The game is a fairly expensive one but when you consider the amount of playing time it is rather reasonable in terms of entertainment costs.',\n",

I say that, but maybe it only feels smoother because I come into this with some existing experience with Lancashire, whereas when first playing Lancashire it was from a blank slate. I think the beer mechanism is cool, and I also question how much it really adds to the game. Mechanically it\\'s the same game fundamentally as Lancashire, only differences are in the details. The distant market push-your-luck element is gone, replaced with merchant beer barrels that are first come first served. Three distinct industry types to pursue and score from. The map does feel slightly more open and permissive. I don\\'t see it as a definitive good or bad thing, it really just comes down to preferences and/or mood. I\\'m probably not going to buy this, but if I had money to burn, I don\\'t see why not to own both versions. Do I think this is the best game in the world? Perhaps if I squint hard and look at it from the right angle, maybe. It\\'s a very multidimensional game of entangled economic interests and network building, more expansive than Lancashire, but also perhaps a little less sharp and to the point. If I have any quibbles about the Brass system in general, it might be that it is next to impossible to gauge how you or anyone else is doing, at least at the level that I\\'m currently playing at. Everyone does \"stuff\", and then you count up the points at the end and see who won. The journey there is fun, for sure, and I do have a general appreciation for well designed opaque games, but at the same time it is missing a little bit the sense of \"Oh I could have clearly made better decisions here and here, and that\\'s why I lost\".',\n",

Much of this game is what I would have expected from a Martin Wallace game: two actions per turn, punishing economy, and precise theme. I'm going to preface the rest of this with a few contextual caveats. First, this is a first impression after a single play. Second, I don't think our teach was particularly good, which I've noticed before from this person (who is otherwise perfectly nice). And third, I did terribly. So with that understood, I really didn't care for the game. I definitely understood what the puzzle was supposed to be, especially with how you could set up select infrastructure during the canal phase to best maximize income and victory in the rail phase. I understood how the shared infrastructure could be a blessing and a curse all at once. And I understood how there was a tight scarcity for resources that could sometimes be mitigated through planning and a dash of luck. But I was just miserable the entire time. The restrictions provided by the game weren't interesting for me. The economy was both brutal and brittle, and didn't really allow for a change to recover from early mistakes. A lack of recovery usually isn't a problem for me, but when your game is decided in the first hour of a three hour game, there's not much to say for the game. A game this brutal needs either guardrails, brevity, or dedication; none of those are really available for a pickup game at a weeknight meetup. I definitely will play this again, since even just this bad experience was enough to show me how to have a better time next time. But my overall impression of the game is that it's probably really fun for people who want to play it a lot, and I don't think I'm there.\",\n",

I\\'m not saying it\\'s not good, but for my taste... it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nMy hatred against this boils down to: in my opinion the rules, the scoring... the game makes no sense.\\nHow?\\nWell, the rules:\\n- Coal needs connection. Check.\\n- Beer needs connection, unless it\\'s yours because then it warps.  Oooookay?\\n- Iron, always warps. What?\\n\\nThe game:\\nYou\\'re trying to be a successful businessman during the industrial revolution by handing over your resources to just anyone... for free. Because after your mine runs out it starts to produce revenue. Because that\\'s what it does!\\nYou can also get successful by building connections between the cities aka. you can have a transportation business. Sounds good! It pays absolutely nothing and only gives victory points at the end of the eras, but it can give half your points! So during the game it\\'s almost entirely useless and you build most of it out of necessity but it\\'s a huge factor in your success. Makes sense? Not for me.\\n\\nAnd what absolutely doesn\\'t influence your success is how much money you make from round to round... because money plays absolutely no role in business, right?!\\n\\nBtw, it\\'s not a strategy game. The biggest strategy you have to \"build\" is when not to spend money. Other than that it\\'s mostly opportunitism and making the most out of the random cards you draw. It\\'s not bad, I just do not understand how is it the no.1 strategy game without any strategy.  :/\\n\\nOh, and the interaction between the players is not positive. Everyone gonna try to take their opponents resources in a way that it is the least beneficial for their opponent. The one taking the resource is not interested in emptying the tile while just getting rid of 1 resorce gives nothing for the owner. It is more like passive agressive.\\n\\nIn short: the game is illogical and the lack of agency over your resources annoys me so much that if I never see this game again even that will be too soon.',\n",

В ней всё здорово переплетается между собой, не смотря на то, что игра на самом деле не простая и комплексная(ну много в ней всякого!), но у меня практически не возникало каких-то вопросов или игровых нюансов и всё сведено к тому, что ты делаешь в свой ход всего лишь 2 действия выбирая из нескольких простых и понятных вариантов, но при этом каждое из этих действий даёт множество выборов и из них интересно выбирать т.к ситуация на поле постоянно изменяется и помимо твоих выборов, влияет и то как будут ходить другие игроки и что они построят в свой ход, ведь они могут забрать твой уголь\\\\пиво или занять ячейку\\\\дорогу на поле, что не всегда является «негативным взаимодействием», а наоборот может увеличить твою прибыль и ты точно так же можешь пользоваться чужими дорогами и ресурсами себе во благо.\\n\\nЯ люблю, когда в играх минимум компонентов и они многофункциональны, что обычно создаёт много выборов и возможностей во время хода, при этом игра не занимает излишне много места на столе. Она радует во всяких мелочах, которые в сумме дают положительный опыт - нет счётчика раундов чтобы отмерять когда наступает вторая эпоха, таймер сделали в виде колоды из которой добираете карты и это не отвлекает вас во время игры. Счётчик победных очков и прибыли объединили сэкономив игровое пространство. Потраченные деньги = порядок хода. Сама иконографика на поле, зданиях, планшетах и жетонах удобная и понятная, при этом они двухсторонние и каждая сторона функциональна, они отображают активное состояние и бонусы, в игре нет ничего что было бы написано\\\\нарисовано просто так для красоты, практически всё имеет какую-то игровую функцию. \\n\\nМне игра понравилась, и не зря она занимает своё высокое место, но для меня она точно не стала топ 1 и вряд ли в мой топ 10 заберётся после этой единственной партии. Не скажу, что у меня были какие-то большие ожидания от игры и они не оправдались, но и нету чувства, что игра меня чем-то зацепила, из-за чего я бы высоко её для себя оценил, это просто очень хорошая игра (не середнячок!), в которую я бы с удовольствием сыграл. Может быть, если появится когда-то в коллекции и мы сыграем побольше партий, мнение изменится, но пока так. ?',\n",

I say this because I think the game doesn\\'t have that much variability, and maybe that just speaks to my preference to have a varied experience in games. Brass is a game that absolutely has \"right\" and \"wrong\" moves for any given board state and combination of cards in hand. So, it is a great puzzle in how to identify and execute the most efficient plays. The economic element is essential to great plays. However, if I were to be critical I think it just doesn\\'t provide the \"wow\" factor of a big play. Let\\'s say you sell your level 5 pottery (something I\\'ve never done). That\\'s great and it feels good, but it doesn\\'t have the same weight for me personally as a big swingy turn in Gloomhaven or even playing 2 big animals in Ark Nova.

However it was more enjoyable at 4 players where there were more opportunities and larger map to strategise over.  Using other people's resources is an interesting feature of the game that usually helps both sides but can also stuff up plans for the other player when you use their last beer and they cannot sell their goods anymore.  The deluxe part of the game really is only the fancy poker chips.  These are fantastic and look and feel premium.  I often get them out to use for other games that require money.\",\n",

       " {'review': 'I have really mixed feelings about this game. The game is good, but I do not think it is great. If i had never played the original Brass, I might feel differently. OG Brass is my favorite game of all time, and this iteration has changes that make the game less what I want at every turn. Part of the beauty of OG Brass was that you got incredibly deep gameplay, a challenging economic system, and an incredible push-pull interaction as you simultaneously made mutually beneficial choices and knifed one another with decisions. And you got all that with a straightforward ruleset. This game manages to increase the rules overhead, add bloat, and, at the same time, make the decisions less deep, the economy less tight, and the interaction less fulfilling. I will continue playing this when others want to bring it out (or occasionally on steam), but I would never choose to play this over the original game.',\n",

I love the design and the good quality elements, not to mention I think it's gorgeous (if you only like my little pony color themes, then you won't appreciate it ofc). I love it has canal and railway era, which creates a natural breakpoint in the game, so if it's late, you got tired, just keep it on the table and you can return next day without any fuss.\\n\\nOnly downside and why it's not 10/10 for me is because I have already played similar style euro games before, so it felt like ... very similar to them. Another problem is the confusing tiny details for each resource, I mean you have a general rule for how to build, how to use iron, beer, coal,  how to sell, but you see there is in just each tiny cases a small change in the rule, so even after several playthrough I had to consult the rulebook cause I was confusing what you can do with iron, enemy iron, beer, enemy beer, merchant beer ... etc etc you see the problem?\\n\\nTactics wise it's not insanely varied, you build, you score, you put your network strategically, nothing special. But, it's a great game, I do feel I can get bored of it after like 10 replay, so not sure how often this will be on the table.\",\n",

Roxley did a fantastic job with preserving what made the original game so fascinating, but they managed to add even more brain burning decisions to the whole system. I love the variable setup and beer as a third resource as they create a completely different dynamic in the game and force players to adapt to a current board state in new ways. It's a very refreshing experience and a true sequel to Martin Wallace's masterpiece. Economic games don't get any better than this.\\n\\nMake no mistake, this is not a streamlined, more friendly version of a classic game. It's even heavier and more demanding in many areas (though I prefer Lancashire as a 2-player experience, especially with the included fan-made variant: it's tighter and way more cutthroat). Both versions sit proudly on the top shelf in my collection. Phenomenal game, just brilliant.\",\n",

Strong core mechanics, very compelling and elegant gameplay and the most kick-ass production for a Euro I have ever seen (without being  over-produced like most KS games I see). This is Brass done right.  Can't wait to play again...& again!\\n\\nMy biggest critique of the game (if at all) is related to its major strength—aesthetics. While the art IS spectacular and looks just that on the computer screen where the light of a thousand suns from tiny pixels bring out all the details, I am afraid the printing process does not do justice to the darker palette. This severely impairs the playing of the game in sub-optimal lighting conditions (many cafes, pubs and non-game room areas in condo apartments have this problem). The location banners have similar tonal values and hence can be hard to identify (again, ONLY in sub-optimal lighting conditions) Having said that, it does look AWESOME in natural daylight and/well-lit rooms. I am only making this point because I am REALLY loving the game and wish it was as perfect as it could have been. \\n\\nAlso, because of the Kickstarter success, it would have been very practical and helpful if a stretch goal was player trays to go with the awesome player mats so all the tiles could be stored in the correct place and the game does not need the 5-6 min painful setup of sorting and placing tiles. Much like games such as Wasteland Express , Reckoners etc. Love the Iron Clays though...cant imagine playing without them!\\n--------------------\\n\\nFavorite things...\\n► Brass: Birmingham reinvents a classic, building upon what worked the most and improving things that did not. The depth the game offers relative to its complexity and ruleset is simply the best.\\n► The player interaction is another highlight for me. The game works like a dynamic shared economy where every action affects others—networks, market prices, and resource access make Brass feel alive and competitive. This is my absolute favorite kind of player interaction.\\n► There are multiple paths to victory, which serve a varied degree of challenges, allowing players to pick what seems most challenging and/or fun for them.\\n\\nMore, on this & other games in my ALL TIME - TOP 100  on my ⟣⧗First Pass⧗⟢ Blog:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/blog/9052/blogpost/172984/anim8rs-top-100-from-1000-2024-25-to-01\",\n",

Yes, you can cut someone's network short with your own, but that means you're likely cutting your own network too. Other players can use each other's networks anyway in many cases.

It is all about the action efficiency, stupid! :)\\n- you are working towards your own goals but along the way other players will most likely also benefit from your activities - and vice versa. Whether it is building a connection or supplying resources. Sometimes it makes me wonder: so this is how capitalism works - everyone works for their own advantage but it somehow all falls into place and everyone is better off?!? On average at least…\\n- yet you can also hurt other players by occupying spaces they have had their eyes on or forcing them to connect your network to dealers \\n- beautiful map and art although a bit too much the dark side \",\n",

There's really only a few actions you're taking and you're limited to the cards in your hand, but there's an astonishing amount to consider. The nature of the rules and actions also result in new players feeling completely lost for the first half of the game. Thankfully there is an option to just only play one half. You lose out on a lot of the meaty planning ahead strategy, but new players can't comprehend that anyway. Allows you to still play through a teaching game in a couple of hours.
